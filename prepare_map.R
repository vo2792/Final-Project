         Starbucks is growing strong! As of 2017, it has <strong>",
         totalnum, "</strong> recorded locations worldwide, spreading across
         <strong>", num_coun, "</strong>countries. For the sake of tidiness,
         <br>
         the tables shown below are limited to only display the top ten
         countries and cities that have the most Starbucks stores respectively.
         <br>
         <em>", top_country, "</em> stays on top of the record for having
         <strong>", num_top_country, "</strong> stores, followed by <em>",
         second_country, "</em> where it has <strong>", num_second_country,
         "</strong> stores across the country.
         <br>
         For what's not shown on the table, <em>", least_country, "</em> has
         only <strong>", num_least_country, "</strong> Starbucks location across
         the country. Another interesting side to look at is the number
         <br>
         of stores each city has. <em>Shanghai</em> tops the list by having
         <strong>", num_top_city, "</strong> stores. In the meantime, there are
         <em>", num_city_one_store, " cities </em> with only <strong>1</strong>
         Starbucks store.
         </p>
         <p>Another interesting fact observed from the dataset is that
         <em>", aus, "</em> despite spanning 2.97 millions square miles
         only has <strong>", num_aus, "</strong> Starbucks's locations,
         <br>
         which may be worth investigating why Starbucks is not expanding
         well in Australia.

         There are definitely many more things to be explored. Feel free

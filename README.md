[Starbucks Project](https://vo2792.shinyapps.io/Final-Project/)

# An Initial Proposal of Final Project.

## Project Description

We will be working with `.csv` files that contain information about the **[Worldwide Locations of Starbucks](https://www.kaggle.com/starbucks/store-locations#directory.csv)** and the **[Nutrition Facts](https://www.kaggle.com/starbucks/starbucks-menu)** for each Starbucks' drink menu item. We obtained both datasets from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/). Also, we use the country codes dataset from [this kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/juanumusic/countries-iso-codes#wikipedia-iso-country-codes.csv). Our **main target audience** will be **coffee connoisseurs** around the world. Our objective is to provide a some specified information that we find important to address:

> The **highest** and **lowest** calorie drinks from Starbucks' menu.

> The **total number** of Starbucks franchises in the world.

> What country has the **most** Starbucks chains in the world.

> The mean calories of a particular Starbucks drink (proposed by TA)
## Technical Description

We will be using `.csv` files for the datasets (that's what we've found so far). For the presentation of data, we will be producing an **_interactive map_** (leaflet), **_bar graph(s)_** (ggplot2), and the _entire structure_ will be represented on a _Shiny Application_.

Initial setup for libraries (for now):


- `leaflet`
- `shiny`
- `ggplot2`


Some **major challenges** that we anticipate are **debugging** and the process of **merging multiple files**.

We may challenge ourselves by applying machine learning techniques in this final project.

Best of luck!

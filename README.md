# An initial proposal of final project.

## Project Description

We will be working with APIs that specify the worldwide location of Starbucks [Starbucks Location Worldwide](https://www.kaggle.com/starbucks/store-locations#directory.csv) and the nutrition facts for Starbucks's menu [Nutrition Fact for Starbucks Menu](https://www.kaggle.com/starbucks/starbucks-menu). We obtain both datasets from [**kaggle.com**](https://www.kaggle.com/). Our main target audience will be coffee lovers around the world. We serve to provide a few informations that we find important to address:

> The highest and lowest calories drinks of Starbucks

> How many Starbucks locations are in the world

> What country has the most Starbucks in the world

## Technical Description

We will be using .csv files for the datasets. For the presentation of data, we will be doing an _interactive map_ (leaflet), a _bar graph_ (ggplot2), and the _whole structure_ will be based on Shiny.

Initial setup for libraries:

```
- library(leaflet)
- library(Shiny)
- library(ggplot2)
```

Some major challenges that we anticipate are debugging, debugging and debugging... Also, we expect facing some obstacles in merging multiple files.

We might challenge ourselves by applying machine learning techniques in this final project.

Best of luck!
